Data combined from various test cases
- In half the test cases, process flow is fixed
- In the other half of the test cases, motive flow is fixed
- In each half, there are test cases where
   - all RPXs are running
   - 11 RPXs are running
   - 10 RPXs are running
   - 8 RPXs are running
   - 7 RPXs are running
   - 6 RPXs are running

Features include (30 total)
- Process and Motive flows for each of the 12 RPXs (24 columns)
- Average Process & Motive Flows as well as Standard Deviations (4 columns)
